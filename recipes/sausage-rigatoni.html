        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is one of my wife's favorites (albeit without the chili flakes). She calls it "Covid Pasta" after making it so much at home during lockdown. It's a delicious dish that's deceptively easy to put together.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 oz rigatoni pasta</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 md yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 lb Italian sausage (removed from casings)</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 14.5oz can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 8oz can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried basil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
