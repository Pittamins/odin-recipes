            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Burgers are something I've only just started to get the hang of. I think it was the over abundance of people with <strong>very strong</strong> opinions on the <em>right</em> and <em>wrong</em> ways to cook a burger that intimidated me. That sort of exclusionary mindset is so frustrating. I have no idea what the best burger is -- I don't think there is one. But what I do know is that this one is good and easy. With only 5 ingredients, how could it not be?</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Buns (any buns will do, but brioche or potato buns are my favorites)</li>
                <li>1 lb 75% lean ground beef (the higher fat content is great for burgers, but don't sweat it if you've got leaner beef)</li>
                <li>6 slices american cheese (go for the stuff at the deli counter -- it tastes better and melts like a dream, unlike the cellophane wrapped singles)</li>
                <li>1 sweet onion</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a heavy cast iron skillet on medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Form the beef into 6 equally sized balls.</li>
                <li>Slice the onion very thin so it's translucent. If you have a mandolin, use the smallest setting, otherwise cut as thin as possible with a sharp knife.</li>
                <li>Place a ball of ground beef on the hot skillet, season with a sprinkle of salt, then top with a hearty pile of onions. Using a grill press, metal spatula, or whatever else you can find, smash the burger down super thin so the edges become lacy.</li>
                <li>Cook the burger until the onions on the edge of the patty become crisp and caramelized, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Flip the patty so the onions cook on the bottom. Add a slice of cheese on the patty. Place the top bun on top of the cheese, then the bottom bun on top of that. Cook another 3 minutes or so until desired doneness.</li>
                <li>Lift the patty off with the spatula, then take the bottom and put it under the spatula, so you can slide the burger right off.</li>
            </ol>
