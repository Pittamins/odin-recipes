This is my first project in The Odin Project curriculum. I am to use my HTML knowledge to build a website for my recipes.

I will use links for recipes across the web, possibly adding in my own recipes with pictures to the body of web pages, and may other skills learned so far. 

I will use this space further at the end of the project as a self-reflection.
